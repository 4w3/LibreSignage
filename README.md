# LibreSignage - An open web based Info TV system

LibreSignage is a free and open source Info TV system based on a simple HTTP
webserver model where the server hosts the Info TV content so that the 
clients only need have web browsers installed. This also makes it
possible to remotely edit the information screens using a web interface
(which is not yet implemented).

LibreSignage is under heavy development and it shouldn't be used for
production or anything important.
