LibreSignage - An Open Source Digital Signage Solution
######################################################

LibreSignage is a free and open source, lightweight and easy-to-use
digital signage solution. LibreSignage runs on a HTTP web server serving
content to normal web browsers. This makes it possible to use basically
any device with the ability to display web pages from the internet as
a client for a LibreSignage instance. Development takes place on
`GitHub <https://github.com/eerotal/LibreSignage>`_. You can view the
source, report bugs and collaborate there.

LibreSignage includes an intuitive but powerful web interface for
creating, editing and deleting slides as well as managing users of
the LibreSignage instance. Extensive LibreSignage help and documentation
can be found `here </doc>`_.

LibreSignage is made possible by the fantastic open source libraries
Bootstrap_, jQuery_, Popper.js_ and Ace_ and the open fonts Raleway_,
Montserrat_ an Inconsolata_. The cool icons used in the LibreSignage web
interface are from the Font-Awesome_ project. These libraries and other
resources are licensed under their respective licenses. The licensing
information for all third party resources can be found
