# LibreSignage User Settings

The _Settings_ page is accessible by all LibreSignage users. On this page
the users can view their username and groups and change their password.

Passwords can be changed by writing the new password into the _Password_
and _Confirm password_ input fields and clicking save. If the two fields
match, the password is changed. The maximum length of passwords is defined
in the LibreSignage instance config and can be changed by the server admin.
The default limit is 256 characters.
