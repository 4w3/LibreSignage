v0.1.0
  - Implement keyboard shortcuts for the editor.
  - Make it possible to preserve instance data when reinstalling.
  - Implement a live slide preview in the editor.
  - Self host font files. (I actually don't particularly like including
    binary files in the GIT tree but I don't know of a better way so
    the font files are now included in the tree.)
  - Use SCSS instead of plain CSS for the stylesheets.
  - Import Bootstrap straight into the _default.scss file instead of
    including it in the HTML <head> tag.
  - Process CSS using PostCSS /w Autoprefixer.
